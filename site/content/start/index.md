# Getting started

## Download signal flag images

<a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://github.com/signal-flags/signal-flag-images/archive/v1.1.0.zip">Download a zip archive</a>

## Extract the files

Software to extract zip archives is built in to many operating systems including
[Windows](https://www.google.com/search?q=site:microsoft.com+windows+extract+zip),
[MacOS](https://www.google.com/search?q=site:apple.com+macos+extract+zip),
and most flavours of
[Linux](https://www.google.com/search?q=linux+extract+zip).

## Locate the files you want

Our main designs are included in the four folders
- `signal-flags-outline`
- `signal-flags-no-outline`
- `signal-flags-square-outline`
- `signal-flags-square-no-outline`

We have also included images with square alphabet flags in primary colours; this
is the format used on
[WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_maritime_signal_flags)
and (except for the swallowtail flags A and B) in
[Flags Of the World](https://www.fotw.info/flags/xf~ics.html)
- `signal-flags-square-no-outline-primary`
